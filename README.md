### Introduction
[1] The Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts serves as a public oasis within the Boston public park system, an educational center, and a living collection of tree species. Like a museum, the living archive of temperate woody plants live on 281 acres for the public to visit. There are currently 169 different larch trees representing six different species at the Arnold Arboretum, and some variations within the genus, including the weeping larch (Larix decidua ‘Pendula’) and the golden larch (Pseudolarix). The Arboretum has ensured that the trees have a documented [provenance](https://arboretum.harvard.edu/explorer/) and can be traced back to their place of origin as a seed, acting as a living archive and connecting them to place. The larches keep the time with their deciduous needles, a lively golden expression of fall in October, and a signal of new life in April with vibrant near-fuchsia cones and baby-green needles.

[2] Humanity’s fascination with trees has been expressed in so many ways across time, from cosmology to botany, landscape design to recreation. This story will unravel one history of an ancient tree, the larch. The story follows how various peoples have revered the larch, or larix, over centuries—from Siberian shamanist rituals held for millennia to the classification of the species into rigid western botanical studies beginning in the 18th century. Based on the varying representations of the tree through indigenous rituals, traditional ecological knowledge, and western scientific botanical taxonomies, the Larch has been viewed as both a life form and specimen, but this story considers how indigenous stories about larch trees can benefit in connecting people to place. As the main protagonist, the larch trees carry many histories and beckon a curiosity for how a palimpsest of narratives can coexist for a future of landscape, and the role indigenous knowledge can have in understanding the condition of living systems.

[3] The Larch is known by many names: Tamarack in common English, Tuuru in one Siberian indigenous language called Evenki Tungus, and among the Ojibwe people, an Anishinaabe tribe native to Ontario, Quebec, and Great Lakes regions, “mashkiigwaatig”.  In Potawatomi, “manbemesh.” In the Algonquin language, “menahekwa.”  The Ojibwe word is very similar to the word that Potawatomi people use to refer to all plants, mshkikinek, or “the growers of the world.” According to indigenous biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer, the word also directly translates as “the medicines,” with the root mshkiki meaning “strength of the earth.”  Some names are very specifically related to Native American worldviews of the interrelated network of plants and humans, while others such as “tamarack” were conflated and now are commonly used to refer to more than one species of larch.  The name tamarack is said to have been derived from an Algonquian word which was mispronouned, “akemantak,” then “Hackmatack,” meant to have been translated to “wood used for snowshoes,” though when and where the first documentation of this conflation of terms occurred is unclear.  image: Cree woman building snowshoes from larch wood
