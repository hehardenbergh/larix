### Introduction
The Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts serves as a public oasis within the Boston public park system, an educational center, and a living and growing collection. Like a museum, the 281 acres of temperate woody plants have become a growing collection for the public to visit, a living archive of deep time. There are currently 169 different larch trees representing six different species at the Arnold Arboretum and some variations within the genus, including the weeping larch (Larix decidua ‘Pendula’) and the golden larch (Pseudolarix). The Arboretum has ensured that the trees hold provenance (its place or source of origin) [LINK TO ARBORETUM EXPLORER] from its native origin and can be traced back to its geographic origins as a seed, often times overseas. The Arboretum was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted specifically to showcase these species alongside many others to represent the world’s tree biodiversity. The larches keep the time with their deciduous needles, a lively golden expression of fall in October, and a signal of new life in April with vibrant near-fuchsia cones and baby-green needles. Perhaps it is this simple signal of deep time that intrigues us every spring, beckoning us outside, that the larch somehow knows more than we do, a deep understanding of the world that is unbothered by social constraints.
