### Introduction
[*Ilex paraguariensis*](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:315555-2) is an evergreen shrub
[1] The Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts serves as a public oasis within the Boston public park system, an educational center, and a living collection of tree species. Like a museum, the living archive of temperate woody plants live on 281 acres for the public to visit. There are currently 169 different larch trees representing six different species at the Arnold Arboretum, and some variations within the genus, including the weeping larch (Larix decidua ‘Pendula’) and the golden larch (Pseudolarix). The Arboretum has ensured that the trees have a documented [provenance](https://arboretum.harvard.edu/explorer/) and can be traced back to their place of origin as a seed, acting as a living archive and connecting them to place. The larches keep the time with their deciduous needles, a lively golden expression of fall in October, and a signal of new life in April with vibrant near-fuchsia cones and baby-green needles. image: pseudolarix provenance; & Arboretum in fall.

[2] Humanity’s fascination with trees has been expressed in so many ways across time, from cosmology to botany, landscape design to recreation. This story will unravel one history of an ancient tree, the larch. The story follows how various peoples have revered the larch, or larix, over centuries—from Siberian shamanist rituals held for millennia to the classification of the species into rigid western botanical studies beginning in the 18th century. Based on the varying representations of the tree through indigenous rituals, traditional ecological knowledge, and western scientific botanical taxonomies, the Larch has been viewed as both a life form and specimen, but this story considers how indigenous stories about larch trees can benefit in connecting people to place. As the main protagonist, the larch trees carry many histories and beckon a curiosity for how a palimpsest of narratives can coexist for a future of landscape, and the role indigenous knowledge can have in understanding the condition of living systems. image: larix pure stand in Cascade mountains.

In the Pacific Northwest, larch season is not one to miss. Long swaths of gold can be found in the mountains, as larix occidentalis (Western Larch) makes a great spectacle for fall hikes. Larix laricina (American larch, eastern larch, or tamarack tree), with a water-loving root system, can be found in wetlands and bogs across the Northern hemisphere from the Great Lakes region to New England. Its Asian counterparts siberica have inhabited the Northern taiga in Siberia for at least 900 years, and potaninii and kaempferi in the temperate forests in China and Japan, respectively. There are many other species in eastern Asia, such as the Himalayan or Sikkim Larch (Larix griffithii), the Yunnan Larch (Larix griffithii var. speciosa), Langtang Larch (Larix himalaica), the “Master’s Larch” (Larix mastersiana) and the Dahurian Larch (Larix gmelinii). Each of these species, though they may appear very similar physically, have distinct biological properties that set them apart. Some can grow above permafrost, some are more susceptible to pollutants in urban environments, and some That the beautiful colors of larch season are catalyzed by annual decay and renewal sparks any park goer’s interest in the ephemerality of this tree. Magic, medicine, mythology, the larch is known for it all.
