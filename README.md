### Introduction
[1] The Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts serves as a public oasis within the Boston public park system, an educational center, and a living collection of tree species. Like a museum, the living archive of temperate woody plants live on 281 acres for the public to visit. There are currently 169 different larch trees representing six different species at the Arnold Arboretum, and some variations within the genus, including the weeping larch (Larix decidua ‘Pendula’) and the golden larch (Pseudolarix). The Arboretum has ensured that the trees have a documented [provenance](https://arboretum.harvard.edu/explorer/) and can be traced back to their place of origin as a seed, acting as a living archive and connecting them to place. The larches keep the time with their deciduous needles, a lively golden expression of fall in October, and a signal of new life in April with vibrant near-fuchsia cones and baby-green needles.

[2] Humanity’s fascination with trees has been expressed in so many ways across time, from cosmology to botany, landscape design to recreation. This story will unravel one history of an ancient tree, the larch. The story follows how various peoples have revered the larch, or larix, over centuries—from Siberian shamanist rituals held for millennia to the classification of the species into rigid western botanical studies beginning in the 18th century. Based on the varying representations of the tree through indigenous rituals, traditional ecological knowledge, and western scientific botanical taxonomies, the Larch has been viewed as both a life form and specimen, but this story considers how indigenous stories about larch trees can benefit in connecting people to place. As the main protagonist, the larch trees carry many histories and beckon a curiosity for how a palimpsest of narratives can coexist for a future of landscape, and the role indigenous knowledge can have in understanding the condition of living systems.

[3] The Larch is known by many names: Tamarack in common English, Tuuru in one Siberian indigenous language called Evenki Tungus, and among the Ojibwe people, an Anishinaabe tribe native to Ontario, Quebec, and Great Lakes regions, “mashkiigwaatig”.  In Potawatomi, “manbemesh.” In the Algonquin language, “menahekwa.”  The Ojibwe word is very similar to the word that Potawatomi people use to refer to all plants, mshkikinek, or “the growers of the world.” According to indigenous biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer, the word also directly translates as “the medicines,” with the root mshkiki meaning “strength of the earth.”  Some names are very specifically related to Native American worldviews of the interrelated network of plants and humans, while others such as “tamarack” were conflated and now are commonly used to refer to more than one species of larch.  The name tamarack is said to have been derived from an Algonquian word which was mispronouned, “akemantak,” then “Hackmatack,” meant to have been translated to “wood used for snowshoes,” though when and where the first documentation of this conflation of terms occurred is unclear.  image: Cree woman building snowshoes from larch wood

[4] Larch tree species belong to the genus larix in the pine family. There are 10-15 species recognized by scientists, with some debate on the interrelated details within the genus: Larix griffithii, Siberica, Potaninii, Kaempferi, Himalaica, Mastersiana, Gmelinii, Laricina, Decidua, Occidentalis, Lyalli. Larch trees are native to North America, Europe, and Asia in the northern hemisphere and prefer colder climates, like most pines. Unlike any other pine species, however, the larch tree is deciduous, similar to other species such as maple, oak, dawn redwood, and cypress trees, shedding their soft, flaxen needles every fall. The larch stores nutrients in dormancy during winter, adapting to tough climates easily: without needles, the less likely their branches are to break due to the weight of snow and the force of wind, and the more fire-resilient they become with new shoots in the spring. They are monoecious, meaning growing both male (staminate) and female (ovulate) cones on one plant. Most larches will not produce cones until they reach 25 years of age, on average. The roots are fibrous and shallow, and wide-reaching.

[5] In the Pacific Northwest, long swaths of gold needles from larix occidentalis (Western larch) sweep the sunny mountainsides, depending on snowmelt to carry nutrients and water to its roots in early summer. Each species prefers distinct growing conditions that set them apart. Larix laricina (American larch, eastern larch, or tamarack) can be found in wet soil along wetlands and bogs across the Northern hemisphere in Canada and the northeast U.S. Its prominent Asian counterparts are siberica, which has inhabited the Northern taiga in Siberia, and potaninii and kaempferi found in the temperate forests in China and Japan, respectively. larix dahuria, or the Dahurian Larch, can thrive above permafrost, larix decidua is more resistant to pollutants in urban environments, and the advantageous larix Lyallii prefers rock outcrops at an elevation of 7,500 feet in the alpine tundra, higher than any other North American tree species.  Most larch trees live for about 200 years, though the European Larch has been reported to live as long as 2,000 years.

[6] Larches always grow among other tree species, happily in pure stands and occasionally as an understory tree to Douglas firs, ponderosa pine, hemlock, redcedar, lodgepole pine, and black spruce. Their main predators are caterpillars, porcupines, and squirrels. In the summer, ospreys are commonly found nesting in the larch’s crown. Among the three North American larch species, ectomycorrhizal fungi are often found burrowing in its tree bark, microorganisms that are essential for 90% of all temperate and boreal forest trees for nutrient cycling, plant health, decomposition, and carbon sequestration.  Like most forest trees, the larch is part of a network of living systems. image: wetland ecosystem diagram, USGS; & chickadee nest

[7] In addition to studying the species’ characteristics in situ, larch trees were documented, classified, and illustrated in many western botanical texts published between 1768 and 1900. At this time, when western botanists such as Carl Linnaeus began classifying and then taxonomizing plants in the 18th and 19th centuries, the standards of botanical studies did not include any information about traditional ecological knowledge or indigenous knowledge about plants.  There are, however, early European traveler’s journals that mention the medicinal properties of the larch before Linnean classification became the standard. For example, John Josselyn, an English traveler and physician, recorded medicinal uses of larix laricina during his travels up the coast to Boston.  He describes the tannin that can be extracted from the trunk of the larch, knowledge that could very likely have been gleaned from interacting or trading with indigenous tribes in the same region. Josselyn’s accounts and others is just one we can trace some origin of traditional ecological knowledge of the American larch tree through the practice of western botanical science.

[8] In 1663, Josselyn arrived at the port of Nantascot after twenty-seven days aboard the Society, a trading post for the Wampanoag Native Americans and European explorers established in 1644 in the town of Hull, Massachusetts.  Josselyn, whose mentions of the larch were some of the earliest descriptions of flora and fauna in New England, was making his way to Boston to embark on his recording of the New England flora (later praised by American writers such as Henry David Thoreau). Josselyn’s accounts included observations about Native Americans, though his primary interest was botany and herbal medicine. “The Turpentine that issueth from the Cones of the Larch-tree ... is singularly good to heal wounds, and to draw out the malice of any Ach,” Josselyn claimed in An Account of two Voyages to New England, published in 1674.  “Groundsels made of Larch-tree will never rot … Oh, that my Countreymen might obtain that blessing with their buildings,” he writes of the benefits of using larch for timber, whether he knew of its fire-resistant qualities so spoken of by Vitruvius.  This suggests that Josselyn encountered one of many ways white settlers leeched plant knowledge from Native American nations as the American colonies grew.
