### Introduction
[1] Long ago, according to Native American legend, the Tamarack tree was once an evergreen. It painted the hillsides of the Great Lakes region a bright chartreuse green, all year round. Anne M. Dunn, a descendant and storyteller of the Ojibwe people, shares the story of how the tamarack first lost its needles in her book, Fire in the Village: New and Selected Stories.  One winter, an injured chickadee sought shelter under its branches during a fierce storm. But the Tamarack would not lend the bird any needles for warmth. For this, their Great Spirit punished the Tamarack: “Every autumn, your fine green needles will turn brown and fall off. Then you will stand naked in the forest all winter, as a reminder to others that it is always better to be kind and merciful than it is to be vain and selfish.” Through the story, the Tamarack becomes an indicator of something larger than itself—the fleeting ephemeral nature of life on earth, and a reminder of the reciprocity that living beings can nurture.

[2] Humanity’s fascination with trees has been expressed in so many ways across time, from cosmology to botany, landscape design to recreation. This story will unravel one history of an ancient tree, the larch. The story follows how various peoples have revered the larch, or *larix*, over centuries—from Siberian shamanist rituals held for millennia to the classification of the species into rigid western botanical studies beginning in the 18th century. Based on the varying representations of the tree through indigenous rituals, traditional ecological knowledge, and western scientific botanical taxonomies, the Larch has been viewed as both a life form and specimen, but this story considers how indigenous stories about larch trees can benefit in connecting people to place. As the main protagonist, the larch trees carry many histories and beckon a curiosity for how a palimpsest of narratives can coexist for a future of landscape, and the role indigenous knowledge can have in understanding the condition of living systems.

[3] The Larch is known by many names: Tamarack in common English, Tuuru in one Siberian indigenous language called Evenki Tungus, and among the Ojibwe people, an Anishinaabe tribe native to Ontario, Quebec, and Great Lakes regions, “mashkiigwaatig”.[^ref1] In Potawatomi, “manbemesh.” In the Algonquin language, “menahekwa.”[^ref2] The Ojibwe word is very similar to the word that Potawatomi people use to refer to all plants, mshkikinek, or “the growers of the world.” According to indigenous biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer, the word also directly translates as “the medicines,” with the root mshkiki meaning “strength of the earth.”[^ref3] Some names are very specifically related to Native American worldviews of the interrelated network of plants and humans, while others such as “tamarack” were conflated and now are commonly used to refer to more than one species of larch.[^ref4] The name tamarack is said to have been derived from an Algonquian word which was mispronouned, “akemantak,” then “Hackmatack,” meant to have been translated to “wood used for snowshoes,” though when and where the first documentation of this conflation of terms occurred is unclear.[^ref5]

### Characteristics of Larch Trees
[4] Larch tree species belong to the genus larix in the pine family. There are 10-15 species recognized by scientists, with some debate on the interrelated details within the genus: Larix griffithii, Siberica, Potaninii, Kaempferi, Himalaica, Mastersiana, Gmelinii, Laricina, Decidua, Occidentalis, Lyalli. Larch trees are native to North America, Europe, and Asia in the northern hemisphere and prefer colder climates, like most pines. Unlike any other pine species, however, the larch tree is deciduous, similar to other species such as maple, oak, dawn redwood, and cypress trees, shedding their soft, flaxen needles every fall. The larch stores nutrients in dormancy during winter, adapting to tough climates easily: without needles, the less likely their branches are to break due to the weight of snow and the force of wind, and the more fire-resilient they become with new shoots in the spring. They are monoecious, meaning growing both male (staminate) and female (ovulate) cones on one plant. Most larches will not produce cones until they reach 25 years of age, on average. The roots are fibrous and shallow, and wide-reaching.
<param ve-image
       label="Distribution Map of Larix Species"
       url="larch world distribution 1.jpg">
       
[5] In the Pacific Northwest, long swaths of gold needles from larix occidentalis (Western larch) sweep the sunny mountainsides, depending on snowmelt to carry nutrients and water to its roots in early summer. Each species prefers distinct growing conditions that set them apart. Larix laricina (American larch, eastern larch, or tamarack) can be found in wet soil along wetlands and bogs across the Northern hemisphere in Canada and the northeast U.S. Its prominent Asian counterparts are siberica, which has inhabited the Northern taiga in Siberia, and potaninii and kaempferi found in the temperate forests in China and Japan, respectively. larix dahuria, or the Dahurian Larch, can thrive above permafrost, larix decidua is more resistant to pollutants in urban environments, and the advantageous larix Lyallii prefers rock outcrops at an elevation of 7,500 feet in the alpine tundra, higher than any other North American tree species.[^ref6] Most larch trees live for about 200 years, though the European Larch has been reported to live as long as 2,000 years.

[6] Larches always grow among other tree species, happily in pure stands and occasionally as an understory tree to Douglas firs, ponderosa pine, hemlock, redcedar, lodgepole pine, and black spruce. Their main predators are caterpillars, porcupines, and squirrels. In the summer, ospreys are commonly found nesting in the larch’s crown. Among the three North American larch species, ectomycorrhizal fungi are often found burrowing in its tree bark, microorganisms that are essential for 90% of all temperate and boreal forest trees for nutrient cycling, plant health, decomposition, and carbon sequestration.[^ref7] Like most forest trees, the larch is part of a network of living systems.

### Documenting the Larch in Western Botanical Texts
[7] In addition to studying the species’ characteristics in situ, larch trees were documented, classified, and illustrated in many western botanical texts published between 1768 and 1900. At this time, when western botanists such as Carl Linnaeus began classifying and then taxonomizing plants in the 18th and 19th centuries, the standards of botanical studies did not include any information about traditional ecological knowledge or indigenous knowledge about plants.[^ref8] There are, however, early European traveler’s journals that mention the medicinal properties of the larch before Linnean classification became the standard. For example, John Josselyn, an English traveler and physician, recorded medicinal uses of larix laricina during his travels up the coast to Boston.  He describes the tannin that can be extracted from the trunk of the larch, knowledge that could very likely have been gleaned from interacting or trading with indigenous tribes in the same region. Josselyn’s accounts and others is just one we can trace some origin of traditional ecological knowledge of the American larch tree through the practice of western botanical science.

[8] In 1663, Josselyn arrived at the port of Nantascot after twenty-seven days aboard the *Society*, a trading post for the Wampanoag Native Americans and European explorers established in 1644 in the town of Hull, Massachusetts.[^ref9] Josselyn, whose mentions of the larch were some of the earliest descriptions of flora and fauna in New England, was making his way to Boston to embark on his recording of the New England flora (later praised by American writers such as Henry David Thoreau). Josselyn’s accounts included observations about Native Americans, though his primary interest was botany and herbal medicine. “The Turpentine that issueth from the Cones of the Larch-tree ... is singularly good to heal wounds, and to draw out the malice of any Ach,” Josselyn claimed in *An Account of two Voyages to New England*, published in 1674.[^ref10] “Groundsels made of Larch-tree will never rot … Oh, that my Countreymen might obtain that blessing with their buildings,” he writes of the benefits of using larch for timber, whether he knew of its fire-resistant qualities so spoken of by Vitruvius.[^ref11] This suggests that Josselyn encountered one of many ways white settlers leeched plant knowledge from Native American nations as the American colonies grew.

[9] The first classification of North American Larch trees came long before the establishment of the Arnold Arboretum, back to when French botanist Francois Andre Michaux and his father, Andre Michaux, traveled to the newly formed United States in 1785 with a mission of sending back tree specimens to aid in the harvesting of lumber for constructing ships for the French Navy.[^ref12] Francois Michaux recorded the first classification of North American Larches in The North American Sylva.[^ref13] Following in his father’s footsteps, Michaux became a successful botanist and traveler, documenting American plant life more generally.[^ref14] His father had built a relationship with Thomas Jefferson, which enabled him to strike a contract allowing for westward explorations into territories which were then controlled by Spain. This benefitted both Jefferson, who by sending a French naturalist was at little risk of starting conflict with the Spanish, and Andre Michaux could continue his work, or “herboriser,” which translates to English as “to botanize,” as Michaux’s father frequently described his work in his travel journals.[^ref15]

[10] Francois Michaux continued his father’s botanical studies, spending several years documenting the trees in northeastern Unites States and Canada, resulting in a three-volume flora entitled, The North American Sylva; or, A Description of the Forest Trees of the United States, Canada, and Nova Scotia. He later dedicated his time managing farmland in France, interested in the cultivation of trees grown from the seeds he collected in North America. Both Andre and Francois Michaux’s work provided a strong base upon which American botanists were to build scientific knowledge of larch trees for the next century.

[11] Enter Charles Sprague Sargent, a leading American botanist, conservationist, and educator whose work in taxonomizing North American flora became essential to the public’s education of trees that were not native to New England. In 1873, Sargent became the first director of the Arnold Arboretum. Sargent sought to protect American forests from harvesting lumber, and worked alongside landscape architects and city planners to ensure the future of the trees at the Arboretum would be undisturbed. Sargent followed his predecessors in the rigid field of western botany to categorize and document plants for the larger purpose of expanding plant knowledge in the United States, producing his own flora, *The silva of North America: a description of the trees which grow naturally in North America exclusive of Mexico*.[^ref16] The work was quantitative, simple, fundamental, and streamlined, with minimal cultural references. It is in Sargent’s flora, however, that a footnote leads to the story of John Josselyn. With “untiring zeal and energy,” Sargent worked to introduce tree species from China, Siberia, Mongolia, Japan, Korea, Tibet, and Nepal to the U.S. through a series of expeditions led by experienced plant collectors to whom he outsourced his work.[^ref17] What survives of these expeditions are the species that make up the living collection at the arboretum.

[12] Sargent’s interests in Asian species were purely scientific, though he counted on the endeavors of botanists seeking to introduce new plants to nurseries for commercial value. This is how he met E. H. Wilson, who had been collecting seeds for a large nursery in England called Veitch & Sons. He provided much of the text for Plantae Wilsonianae, another flora of species native to Western Sichuan, the seeds of which Wilson sent to Sargent for the Arboretum.[^ref18] Many of the larches that continue to grow on Boston’s soil today originated from expeditions such as Wilson’s.

[13] Wilson collected larix potaninii, Chinese Larch, noting its “decidedly handsome and striking” qualities.[^ref19] He writes of the tree’s practical usefulness for valuable timber in all of western Sichuan region for construction.[^ref20] As Sylvia Barry Sutton, the author of a biography on Sargent, writes, “One is thankful, finally, that it was Wilson and not Sargent who explored China, because it is unlikely that Sargent would have written about anything but the flora.”[^ref21] Indeed, Wilson was interested in much more than the species itself, including cultural references. But if Wilson did record the traditional uses of the Chinese Larch, it was not included in Plantae. It was perhaps included in his more popular travel journals, which were not confined to more strict categorizations. Images: Wilson’s collecting team

### Beyond the Texts: Traditional Ecological Knowledge
[14] Fikret Berkes first defines traditional ecological knowledge in his 1999 text, Sacred Ecology: “The study of traditional ecological knowledge begins with the study of species identifications and classification (ethnobiology) and proceeds to considerations of peoples’ understandings of ecological processes and their relationships with the environment (human ecology). Implied in the concept is a component of local knowledge of species and other environmental phenomena. There is also a component of practice in the way people carry out their agriculture, hunting and fishing, and other livelihood activities. Further, there is a component of belief in peoples’ perceptions of their role within ecosystems and how they interact with natural processes.” He thereafter states, “Stories and legends are part of culture and indigenous knowledge because they signify meaning. Such meaning and values are rooted in the land and closely related to a “sense of place.”[^ref22]

[15] “Narratives of all kinds—stories, tales, and rumors—are the stuff of ideas—concepts and hypotheses—and the stuffing of history,” writes contemporary authors of Dirt.[^ref23] But how do we cite, record, and archive an oral history, especially when those stories have been nearly eradicated through colonial and extractive forces in the history of the US? The larch tree is one answer: a living archive creates a gene pool for data. Larix laricina sweeps across the northeastern United States and blooms into the eastern Canadian provinces among large temperate forests. The stories of these trees are held not only within their DNA, but also within the cultures of the First Nations people who first stewarded the land. What follows is a retelling of Ojibwe descendant and author Anne M. Dunn, who chose to share her ancestors’ respect for the larch tree via storytelling in her book, When Beaver was Very Great. The text includes many short stories that are a mixture of traditional Ojibwe tales and modern storytelling, preserving a way of and a perspective of reciprocal understanding about living systems life that predates western botany.[^ref24] The origin story tells of the Tamarack’s fall from grace in the lakeside forests of Minnesota.

[16] In addition to living legends as a sign of respect for traditional lifestyles and plant knowledge, the larch tree is historically known both by First Nations and traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners for its medicinal uses.[^ref25] Across the Pacific, in a vastly different ecosystem within the Russian and Siberian taiga, many indigenous nomadic peoples believe that the larch tree holds great spiritual power and is the connection between their spiritual and physical worlds. Since as early as 600 A.D., the Evenki people, nomadic groups of three to ten immediate families indigenous to northern Siberia and parts of Mongolia and eastern China, held the larch tree near for both practical uses and spiritual meaning. The needles were historically used as insulation inside shelters to protect from the frozen ground in winter. The timber was also used for crafting ceremonial sculptures, such as carvings of birds that sit atop a “spirit pole” at the residence of a shaman to signify the connection between the human and spirit worlds.[^ref26] The spirit pole is thought to be the point of connection between the spirits and the community.[^ref27]

       label="copper engraving of a Sami Shaman in Scandinavia"
       url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Shaman.jpg">

[17] The Evenki people believed that the larch tree, or Tuuru, in their Tungus language which translates as “world tree” in English, was one way to connect their three worlds: the upper world, housing deities and spirits of nature, the middle world inhabited by humans, and the lower world, home to spirits of the dead.[^ref28] Similarly, the Buryat people, who also indigenous to south-central Siberia, consider the birch tree their “World Tree.” Shamanic traditions still survive today, including securing ribbons to the tree trunk to symbolize a myriad of offerings for the spirits.[^ref29] Interestingly, thousands of plants of Larix siberica dot the shores of Lake Baikal, where the Buryat people live. Their offerings can be found tied to the ancient larches, cranking their way up towards the sun in search of nutrients, and passing down knowledge from the spirits above. Whether it is Buryat or Evenki shamans placing them, colorful ribbons adorn the most sculptural, wiry branches and trunks of the leafless monuments.

[18] The Chinese Reindeer-Evenki are a small nomadic group of only two hundred people. Their cultural history and future are in danger of extinction. Nevertheless, they continue to practice traditional ways of life including looking to their shaman as a “mediator between human society and the world of spirits.”[^ref30] Under the shaman’s leadership, the clan, or kala in Tungus northern dialect, respects that all events in nature, including the birth and death of all people, are attributed to the spirits of the upper world.[^ref31] Symbolically, the Tuuru was the physical symbol of how the spirits traveled between worlds and was therefore significant for Evenki cosmology.

### Design Considerations
[19] Traditional knowledge practices teach us more about plants than medicinal and practical purposes. They teach us about our relationship to larger ecological systems. They relate us to place. Through oral traditions such as the Ojibwe legend about the tamarack, we begin to further understand the context of the species, as in, the place in which it exists.  We begin to understand the patterns of humans and plants through one species, and the symbioses between us. Through this general restructuring of living systems, our objectives for designing spaces can shift as well. It can represent those plant-people relationships by planting certain species together, making connections by storytelling through plants. The key in this description of using plants as the catalyst for the design is that it must come in collaboration with the people whose stories are being told. The design thereby becomes the agent, and the people become the protagonist. If one is to tell the story of the larch tree through a design, it depends entirely on the stories which have preceded it. 
<param ve-image

       url="Larch, from The Park and the Forest 1841.jpg">

[20] That the beautiful colors of larch season are catalyzed by annual decay and renewal sparks any park goer’s interest in the ephemerality of the larch tree. Aesthetically, larch species are not a popular choice for design projects, but there is a huge opportunity to consider them as a proponent for encouraging wetland habitats across New England. Larch forests usually have a dense herbaceous layer, and a somewhat full shrub layer, taking part in a rich ecosystem along riparian borders.  Additionally, in the United States wetland habitat was historically filled in to transform marshes into fields that could sustain agricultural crops. At the time of European settlement, the U.S. region (excluding Alaska) had 221 million acres of wetlands. By 1980s, 50% of these wetlands had disappeared. Generally viewed as wastelands in the 1700s, colonizers began constructing ditches to drain wetlands along the American colonies, and rerouting waterways into canals to navigate to western regions. Manipulation of American watersheds continued through the industrial revolution and increased sharply in the 1900s through government-supported rebate programs for farmers, levees, water-diversion projects, and dams.

[21] Wetlands are incredibly biodiverse ecosystems, an important component for ecological health. They enhance water quality, control erosion, sequester carbon, and provide crucial habitat for threatened species.[^ref32] The protection of American wetland regions began slowly, in the 1950s, and in the 1980s federal efforts have aided in restoring about 90,000 acres in just three years. They also create a unique sense of place with their seasonal changes, their dynamic dropping of needles, their affinity for living among other forest trees creates a density and a prickliness that makes it difficult to wander between, if they are growing closely. A larch at the marsh edge signifies abundant water in the soil, which may lead to further investigations about its context.

[22] The larch tree could be the poster child of wetland restoration given its ephemeral qualities and its affinity to live among a wide variety of other flora. Its associations with soil, wind, water, bugs, and people are at the core of understanding how a wetland ecosystem can function and thrive properly. In an effort to conserve marshes along the eastern coast and great lakes regions of the United States, larch species could be carefully considered for a role in drawing attention towards the significance and history of these landscapes.

### Where We Are Now 
[23] Rather than glimpsing at a tamarack tree in winter and assuming it aesthetically unproductive, consider its role in the larger ecosystem in which it lives, including its role with humans. Consider the narratives that have been assigned to the tamarack, the larch, mshkiigwaatig. Perhaps its benefits as a species can further extend beyond telling time between the seasons. Perhaps it can help us connect further to a landscape that has been previously considered “wasteland,” or a people whose stories have been historically erased. Its chartreuse green in spring signals not only new growth but humility, its tough bark not only productive construction material but grit. Consider why, to you, the larch trees lose their needles every fall, and what its purpose is. What are the visual cues that can aid in understanding a species’ role within a larger ecosystem?

[24] Indigenous scholars have continued to practice and study traditional ecological knowledge from both their ancestral lineage and from scholarly pursuits. It is apparent that plant knowledge, while the U.S. government attempted to erase it during the 19th century, is invaluable in understanding how people are connected to plants. Plants are, in Potawatomi, literally, “miishkikinek,” or, “the medicines.” Indigenous scientists, ethnobotanists, and biologists such as Robin Wall Kimmerer and Rosalyn LaPier have studied extensively how traditional ecological knowledge connects, rather than divides, the layers of human and botanical living systems. Understanding how indigenous tribes read the landscape allows for the understanding of a place through its original stewards.[^ref33] Considering what the land used to look like and how it used to be cultivated is important in filling the holes of understanding the soil beneath our feet, and righting the misnomers that were created in an effort to divide people from land, rather than connect it.

[25] Traditional practices protect ecosystems by forging a strong connection of people with place through an understanding of plant systems and relationships. When considered alongside western botanical studies, the two sources of knowledge have very different perspectives to offer. In using texts such as Sargent’s flora of north American sylva to identify the larch, and in considering the spiritual meaning of the species for shaman rituals, a sense of place can be understood more meaningfully as a complex network of individuals coexisting in places that are unique to the climate, species, and rituals of that area.

[^ref12]: Predating Michaux, the larch tree had been identified in Europe by English botanist Philip Miller who published descriptions in *The Gardeners Dictionary* in 1768, and German-Estonian botanist Carl Frederich Ledebour, who authored *Flora Altaica* by 1833.
[^ref13]: Originally published in French in 1810, and later in English in 1817, this taxonomy was later enhanced with the work of botanist Thomas Nuttall later in the 1850s. The text was one of the first representations of American trees west of the Mississippi River.

[^ref15]: As historian Elizabeth Hyde defines this term, Michaux was spending time in the field in order to “know” the plants, and to use them for which the purposes are fit. But not only did he identify them, but he classified them, collected them, and contextualized species within a larger scientific community and way of thinking. He was one of the first botanists in the United States to do this, and his work would continue to be valuable for the development of French gardens and forests into the 19th century.
